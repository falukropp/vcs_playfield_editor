# What is this

Just a simple editor custom-made for a stupid-ass VCS game I done did.

# Things TODO... maybe:
- Editor
    - Copy/paste
- Map - editor
    - Create / select separate levels
- Data
    - Export / Import

# Running
Well, it's just a simple HTMLpage, run directly in a favorite IDE or something like this:
```
python -m http.server <someport>
```
